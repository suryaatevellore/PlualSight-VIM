<h1>Editing - Folding</h1>

<p>In the classic science fiction novel <em>Dune</em>, people learn how to "travel without moving" by folding space and then taking a single step onto a new planet far away.</p>

<p>In the current physical world this is only a dream, but in Vim, you definitely can navigate a file and operate on lines by folding large ranges of text.</p>

<p>Novices start by using folds to fit more content on the screen. Experts use folds to perform searches or global operations on blocks of code as a single line.</p>

<p>You may find that your mind doesn't naturally think in terms of folds. That's OK -- some people find them indispensable and others don't use them at all. After this chapter, you'll have a grip on what they can do and how to use them.</p>

<h2>Folding</h2>

<p>Vim offers several folding strategies, configured by <code>foldmethod</code>.  By default it's <code>manual</code>, meaning you have to set your own folds. But you can have Vim set up folds automatically based on </p>

<ul>
<li>indent</li>
<li>syntax highlighting rules</li>
<li>markers in the text</li>
<li>unchanged text (used in diff views)</li>
<li>or, if none of the above float your boat, your own custom expression</li>
</ul>

<p>Bear in mind that Vim doesn't contain a lexer or parser, so if you're folding by <code>indent</code> or <code>syntax</code> you'll inevitably encounter a few corner cases where Vim doesn't get it quite right.</p>

<p>You'll quickly tire of defining folds manually, and we generally don't want to pollute our text with markers.  So where possible I suggest you fold by <code>syntax</code> or <code>indent</code>.</p>

<h3>Syntax Folds</h3>

<p>Let's have a quick look at a Ruby file, where folds are managed by the easiest strategy: syntax. First we'll do this interactively, but most of these commands can be stored in your <code>.vimrc</code> file as permanent defaults.</p>

<p>Type <code>set foldmethod=syntax</code> to set up the folds automatically, or use the abbreviation <code>fdm</code>. It will initially fold everything.</p>

<p>Now we'll open and close some folds.  Move your cursor down to the start of the next fold with <code>zj</code>, and type <code>zo</code> to open it.  <code>zc</code> closes it, while <code>za</code> toggles it open and closed.  As you would expect, you can move back up to the end of the previous fold with <code>zk</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to close all folds or open all folds.  <code>zM</code> (most folding) and <code>zR</code> (reduce, or open, every fold) will do the trick.  Or you could toggle folding on or off altogether with <code>zi</code>.</p>

<p>If you've made a pickle of your folds, you can reset them with <code>zx</code> -- which folds everything except the fold at the cursor's current line -- or <code>zX</code> to fold everything again.</p>

<h3>Indent Folds</h3>

<p>A fallback is to let Vim detect blocks eligible for folding by using simple indentation. CSS is an example of this and will also highlight a few problems that are easily fixed.</p>

<p>Open a CSS file. Set the <code>foldmethod</code> to "indent".</p>

<pre><code>:set foldmethod=indent
</code></pre>

<p>If you try folding a CSS block with <code>za</code>, you'll see an error. Vim's default indentation for CSS and some other files is 8 spaces. Yes, <em>eight</em>!</p>

<p>I'm using only 2 here, so folding won't work until I configure it to match. Two settings are relevant: <code>shiftwidth</code> and also <code>softtabstop</code>. I'll set both to 2.</p>

<pre><code>:set shiftwidth=2
:set softtabstop=2

Lower third: See :h tabstop
Lower third: Run :retab to re-apply spaces instead of tabs
</code></pre>

<p>Now, try <code>za</code> or any other folding command. In this example, the closing brace isn't on it's own line, but that doesn't matter! It works as expected anyway.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Naturally every aspect of folding is configurable.  Some options will apply everywhere, such as the width of the <code>foldcolumn</code>, a handy indicator. Put those in your <code>.vimrc</code> as standard root-level settings.</p>

<p>Others will be file-type specific, such as setting the <code>foldmethod</code> to <code>syntax</code> for Ruby files or setting the <code>shiftwidth</code> as we did interactively. Set those with a filetype autocommand that will take effect when the file is opened:</p>

<pre><code>autocmd FileType ruby setlocal foldmethod=syntax
autocmd FileType css  setlocal foldmethod=indent shiftwidth=2 softtabstop=2
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>setlocal</code> directive configures one or more settings for the current buffer, instead of tweaking settings for all files.</p>

<pre><code>define folds yourself (when foldmethod = manual or marker):
  zf{motion} / {Visual}zf      create a fold
  :{range}fo[ld]               create a fold over range
  zd                           delete fold at cursor
  zE                           delete ("e"liminate) all folds

opening/closing folds:
  zo                           open fold at cursor
  zc                           close fold at cursor
  za                           toggle ("a"lternate) fold at cursor

  zm                           increase foldlevel by one ("m"ore folding)
  zr                           reduce foldlevel by one ("r"educe folding)

  zM                           close all folds ("m"ost folding)
  zR                           open all folds ("r"educe every fold)

  zx                           reset folds but keep cursor line unfolded
  zX                           reset folds

  :{range}foldo[pen]           open folds in range
  :{range}foldc[lose]          close folds in range

moving over folds:
  [z                           move to start of currently open fold
  ]z                           move to end of currently open fold

  zj                           move downwards to start of next fold
  zk                           move upwards to end of previous fold

enable/disable folding (workflow: enable, move to where you want, disable, do your stuff, enable):
  zn                           disable folding ("n"o folding)
  zN                           enable folding
  zi                           toggle folding
</code></pre>

<p>If you're a heavy user of folding and you use Ruby, Objective Caml, PHP, Perl or Java, I suggest you check out Mauricio Fernandez's <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1868">simplefold</a> plugin.  It's got a lot of nice features and it could be just the ticket for you.</p>

<h2>Advanced Tip</h2>

<p>Expert Vim user Eric Hodel sends in this tip. </p>

<ul>
<li>Fold a Ruby method block with <code>za</code></li>
<li>Run a substitution on it with the <code>g</code> flag. No range is needed.</li>
<li>Toggle it open again with <code>za</code>.</li>
<li>Voila! The replacement was effective for all the folded lines.</li>
</ul>
